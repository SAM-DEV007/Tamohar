**Problem Statement**:\
Enhancement of Permanently Shadowed Regions (PSR) of Lunar Craters Captured by OHRC of Chandrayaan-2

**Problem Description**:\
This project aims to enhance (Low Light Image Enhancement) the feeble light reflected from PSR regions of Lunar craters into a better SNR image for interpretations. Challenge: Feeble signal to better signal image generation. Low light image noise removal. Usage: For generating first of its kind PSR image map of lunar poles captured by OHRC of Chandrayaan-2. Users: Landing site selection users and geomorphological application users. Available Solutions (if Yes, reasons for not using them): Specific solution of Chandrayaan-2 needs to be developed. General techniques and algorithms are available. Desired Outcome: Software for generating low light image enhancement.
